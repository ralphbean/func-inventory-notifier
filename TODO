rewrite this in pure python and release back to the func-inventory guy

func groups?

func mount/user dirs?

func and iptables?

func and sendmail?

---
func filetracker on all of /etc on lukacs.
    have to ignore *git*
    and "*/\.*" # everythign beginning with a dot.
    and have to look out for including /etc/func/modules/filetracker (lol, recursion)
    look at to-be-monitored list and get stuff working locally
